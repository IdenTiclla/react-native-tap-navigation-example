        "description": "The Cristo Redentor was erected in the decade of the 60's, its construction is linked to an important event of the Catholic Church. It was one of the first monuments that the city had and is one of the highest exponents and symbols of faith, struggle and union, so much so that countless transcendental events have taken place at its feet. The imposing sculpture has seen the city grow and welcomes and says goodbye to travelers arriving to the lands of Gran Grigotá. Christ the Redeemer, 7.5 meters high, with outstretched arms and serene gaze, is an icon of the city of Santa Cruz de la Sierra, was carved in bronze in La Paz, by the sculptor Emiliano Luján and taken to its destination with resources raised by the ladies of Santa Cruz de la Sierra in the early 1960s. Some records of the Catholic Church show that when the monument and its base were being prepared to take its place, many people chose to pray during this time, many people chose to pray for several days until the religious image was erected. When the statue turned 50 years old in 2011, the Church held an event that brought together thousands of faithful who gathered at the feet of the figure and marched in procession to the Cathedral, where a mass was celebrated by the ecclesiastical authorities.

On November 7 of that same year, more than 100 women from the committee went on hunger strike in the Municipal Mayor's Office building, demanding that these payments be met. This was the first hunger strike carried out by women in Bolivia. The civic struggles lasted until 1959, when after two years of confrontations and deaths, the central government made this payment effective. However, the main protagonists of the civic struggles had to leave Bolivia. ",

The Park and its lagoon, today located in the urban center, only five blocks from the Main Square, is a remnant of the old city full of deep reminiscences for the people of Santa Cruz. According to the chronicles, compiled by R. Ferreira, the lagoon was during the 19th and 20th century a natural pond, collector of rainwater, located then in the limits of the city. It was a recreational place where children went swimming and fishing and women washed clothes. It was also a watering place for the thirsty oxen, horses and mules that supplied the city from neighboring provinces. In 1958, work began to convert El Arenal into one of the first recreational areas of Santa Cruz, with its mirror of water, its island and its gardens, which has recently been rescued by the Municipal Mayor's Office from the expansive commercial area of the nearby Los Pozos market, with a modern work of beautification of public ornamentation that has returned the area to public recreation.",

Its author was the sculptor David Paz Ramos, being managed by the Pro Santa Cruz Civic Committee. It was delivered on February 26, 1986. Andrés Ibáñez (Santa Cruz de la Sierra, 1884 - Department of Santa Cruz, May 1, 1877). Bolivian politician and lawyer. Birth and studies: He studied law at the San Francisco Xavier University. He became a lawyer at the age of 24. Political career He founded the Club Igualitario in his hometown. In 1868 he was a municipal councilman and in 1874 he was elected national deputy. On December 25, 1876, the ´´Igualitario´´ declared the ´´Federation´´ and the following day created the Junta Superior Federal del Oriente that issued a proclamation signed by Ibáñez and others that raised the concepts of liberty, fraternity and equality. The measures of the federal government were the collection of taxes from sugar producers, distribution of lands that were not cultivated by the landowners, abolition of servitude in agriculture and in the city, as well as the Junta issued, with the backing of public goods, a new paper money. With the hope of obtaining recognition from the national government, the respective request for authorization of this new form of local power was made, but President Daza responded by mobilizing troops. A Division under the command of the Minister of War Carlos Villegas forced Ibáñez to retreat to the region of Chiquitos, later he was pursued and captured in the hacienda of San Diego, near the border with Brazil, together with a reduced group of co-religionists. Death Ibañez was submitted to a summary war trial in which he was sentenced to death. In the San Diego hacienda, he was shot on May 1, 1877 together with his faithful companions of struggle. Vindication of his image After many years, in 1944 the Bolivian state officially recognized Andrés Ibáñez as 'servant of the national interests', and proceeded to give his name to the province in which the departmental capital, the city of Santa Cruz de la Sierra, is located. Bolivia's autonomy law is named the ´´Andrés Ibáñez Law´´ in his honor.",

        "description": "Monument located at the intersection of Irala and Las Américas Avenues, and La Paz Street (on the first ring road). Its author was the sculptor David Paz Ramos, being managed by the Prefecture of the Department and the Honorable Municipal Mayor´s Office. It was delivered on April 24, 1983, commemorating the bicentennial of the birth of the Liberator.  Biography Simón Bolívar was born in Caracas on July 24, 1783. His parents were Juan Vicente Bolívar and María Concepción Palacios, aristocrats and Creole landowners. In his childhood he was a student of the illustrious Simón Rodríguez and Andrés Bello. In 1799, he traveled to Spain to complete his education. While in Monte Sacro (august 15 1805) he expressed his desire to fight for the freedom of his country. Returning to Venezuela, he became a protagonist of the main events and battles for the Independence of New Granada, which he baptized as the Republic of Gran Colombia. In 1823, he arrived in Peru where he organized the United Liberating Army that won the victories of Junín and Ayacucho (1824). He remained in Lima until 1826 organizing the Federation of the Andes, a project that would unite Gran Colombia, Peru and Bolivia. Returning to Bogotá, he was unable to overcome the nationalist plans of Caracas and Quito. Simón Bolívar resigned from power in April 1830, and retired to Santa Marta. Here his pulmonary phthisis worsened and he died on December 17, 1830.",

It is located in the southwestern part of the city surrounded by the urban sprawl; its use is generally for domestic flights.
